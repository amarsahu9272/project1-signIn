                    My name is Amar Sahu. I am from Jamshedpur. I have completed my Graduation from University Of Calcutta, in computer science and Engineering. Now I am pursuing Front-end course  from FunctionUp.
                    I choose Front-end course because I want to make my career in this field.
                    Coming to my technical skill: I have a basic knowledge about JavaScript,ReactJs,git.
                    If I talk about my hobbies,I love traveling and exploring new places,and listening to music.
                    My weakness is I m getting nervous when I interact with new people but I try to overcome my weakness secondly I trust people easily.
                    My strength is I'm a disciplined person, punctual, and I have a positive attitude.
                    My short-term goal is to get a job in a reputed company and long-term goal is to get a higher position in an organization and want to build my career.
                    That's all from my side.
                    <p>Thankyou!</p>
